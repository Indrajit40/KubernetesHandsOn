Pods:  Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
a pod is group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resoures and a specifction for how to run the conatainer.
You need to install a container runtime into each node in the cluster so that Pods can run there.
A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.
Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:
Pods that run a single container :: The "one-container-per-Pod" model is the most common Kubernetes use case; in this case, you can think of a Pod as a wrapper around a single container; Kubernetes manages Pods rather than managing the containers directly.
Pods that run multiple containers :: that need to work together. A Pod can encapsulate an application composed of multiple co-located containers that are tightly coupled and need to share resources. These co-located containers form a single cohesive unit.

Grouping multiple co-located and co-managed containers in a single Pod is a relatively advanced use case. You should use this pattern only in specific instances in which your containers are tightly coupled.

You don't need to run multiple containers to provide replication (for resilience or capacity); if you need multiple replicas, see Workload management.
